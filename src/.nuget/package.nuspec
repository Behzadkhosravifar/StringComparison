      StringComparison is a library developed for reconciling naming conventions 
      between different models of the electric grid. 
      I have stripped off the power system specific code and put together 
      what can effectively be used as a string extension for determining approximate 
      equality between two strings. All of the algorithms used here have been pulled 
      from online resources, translated into C#, and compiled into this library. 
      I found several other similar open-source implementations around but nothing for .NET/C#. 
      Adding the *.dll to your project will give you access to this extension and 
      the individual extensions under the hood of the IsSimilarity() extension.

    <summary>
      While all of the algorithms are exposed and can be used and can provide their raw results,
      they have been conveniently combined in a way that they can selectively
      be used to judge the approximate equality of two strings.
